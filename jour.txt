I been been carried away and not knowing how to accomplish this. I understand the concepts when it come to coding im facing deer and headlits. Im not parcticing so much. I need to have a clear staregy in how to gete better. I need to have the resources and other things all lined out. that is the only way

How should I do this, there are multutude of resources online. THey are equally confusing. Its boring to read something and do. 

The essense of learning in asking quiestions.. project based is better
