What is numpy?

NumPy stands for Numerical Python and it's a fundamental package for scientific computing in Python. NumPy provides Python with an extensive math library capable of performing numerical computations effectively and efficiently. 

Why numpy?
Even though Python lists are great on their own, NumPy has a number of key features that give it great advantages over Python lists.
1) Speed
2) multidimensional array data structures that can represent vectors and matrices.(a lot of machine learning algorithms rely on matrix operations.)
